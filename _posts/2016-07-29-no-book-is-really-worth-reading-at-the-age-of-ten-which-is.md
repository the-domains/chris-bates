**"No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally -- and often far more -- worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond."**

**"An unliterary man may be defined as one who reads books once only. . . . We do not enjoy a story fully at the first reading. Not till the curiosity, the sheer narrative lust, has been given its sop and laid asleep, are we at leisure to savour the real beauties. Till then, it is like wasting great wine on a ravenous natural thirst which merely wants cold wetness."**

**― C.S. Lewis, On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature**
