  “An unliterary man may be defined as one who reads books once only. . . . We
  do not enjoy a story fully at the first reading. Not till the curiosity, the
  sheer narrative lust, has been given its sop and laid asleep, are we at
  leisure to savour the real beauties. Till then, it is like wasting great wine
  on a ravenous natural thirst which merely wants cold wetness.” ― C.S. Lewis,
  On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature
